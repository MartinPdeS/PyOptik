PyRI
====

PyRI is a tool that can be used to import refractive indexes and extinction
coefficients for different materials at different wavelengths. This data can then
be used for different applications like simulating light interaction's with
particules. All the data comes from RefractiveIndex.INFO.

Throughout the library, a few key acronyms are used:

* wl: wavelength
* ri: refractive index
* ec: extinction coefficient
